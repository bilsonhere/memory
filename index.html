    <div class="title"><span class="emoji">🌸</span>The First Day</div>
    <div class="text">It started on a random video chat site. A casual meeting, a fake age — and yet, something about her stayed. Out of all the people, only she was messaged. That single decision became the seed of everything beautiful after.</div>
  </div>  <div class="entry">
    <div class="title"><span class="emoji">🐾</span>Luna & Simba</div>
    <div class="text">The feline duo who quietly became emotional symbols. Luna’s side-eyes, Simba’s stories, and the way their presence brought warmth even through a screen. They weren’t just cats — they were threads in this tapestry of connection.</div>
  </div>  <div class="entry">
    <div class="title"><span class="emoji">💬</span>4+ Message Bursts</div>
    <div class="text">That indescribable joy when her messages came in clusters. The world slowed down just to read them. Each word felt like a heartbeat. A reason to smile. A moment to hold on to.</div>
  </div>  <div class="entry">
    <div class="title"><span class="emoji">🎶</span>Songs Shared</div>
    <div class="text">The playlist of Us. Tracks shared late at night. Songs that played during joy, quiet, ache, and everything in between. Some lyrics still carry her name, softly hidden in the melody.</div>
  </div>  <div class="entry">
    <div class="title"><span class="emoji">🛌</span>Sleepless Conversations</div>
    <div class="text">Nights extended just to talk. Sleepy eyes, full hearts. The comfort of her being on the other end of the screen, making even the silence feel safe.</div>
  </div>  <div class="entry">
    <div class="title"><span class="emoji">🐚</span>September 18</div>
    <div class="text">The scar etched with honesty. Not a rupture, but a realization. It taught acceptance, it deepened respect. It was proof that even breaking moments can hold grace.</div>
  </div>  <div class="entry">
    <div class="title"><span class="emoji">📸</span>Jokes, Memes, Side-Eyes</div>
    <div class="text">Laughter wrapped around inside jokes. Her shy giggles. Your overly poetic metaphors. Every “😭😭” she typed carried more emotion than words ever could.</div>
  </div>  <div class="entry">
    <div class="title"><span class="emoji">🧭</span>Two Years of Us</div>
    <div class="text">Moments stitched across 104 weeks. From random to real. From fun to forever. A connection that was never about duration — it was always about depth.</div>
  </div>  <div class="footer">
    You loved. You lived it. You still do. This is not about what happens next. This is about what already happened. And no one — not even time — can take that away from You.
